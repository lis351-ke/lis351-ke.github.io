        Post-hardcore is a subgenre of punk and hardcore punk that emerged in
        the 1980s as a response to the increasingly commercialized and
        mainstream nature of punk rock. It is characterized by its aggressive,
        high-energy sound and its fusion of punk rock with other genres such as
        alternative rock, emo, and metal. The roots of post-hardcore can be
        traced back to the Washington, D.C. hardcore punk scene of the early
        1980s, which was home to bands like Minor Threat and Bad Brains. These
        bands rejected the commercialization of punk and focused on creating an
        authentic, DIY punk sound that emphasized fast tempos and aggressive
        vocals. In the mid-1980s, bands like Hüsker Dü and Black Flag began to
        experiment with more melodic and dynamic song structures, paving the way
        for the melodic and experimental elements that would become hallmarks of
        post-hardcore. The term "post-hardcore" was first used to describe bands
        like Fugazi, who emerged out of the D.C. punk scene in the late 1980s.
        Fugazi's music combined the aggression and energy of hardcore punk with
        more melodic and experimental elements, such as intricate guitar work
        and unconventional song structures. Throughout the 1990s, post-hardcore
        continued to evolve and diversify, with bands like At the Drive-In,
        Drive Like Jehu, and Refused incorporating elements of emo, math rock,
        and avant-garde music into their sound. In the 2000s, post-hardcore
        experienced a resurgence in popularity, with bands like Thursday,
        Thrice, and The Used incorporating elements of emo, screamo, and pop
        punk into their sound. These bands, along with others like My Chemical
        Romance and Fall Out Boy, helped to popularize a more melodic and
        accessible version of post-hardcore that came to be known as "emo-pop"
        or "pop-punk." Today, post-hardcore continues to evolve and push the
        boundaries of punk and hardcore punk, with bands like Touché Amoré, La
        Dispute, and Pianos Become the Teeth incorporating elements of
        post-rock, ambient music, and spoken word poetry into their sound.
