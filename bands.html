          Alice in Chains is a Grammy-nominated American rock band formed in
          Seattle, Washington in 1987. The band's original lineup consisted of
          vocalist Layne Staley, guitarist Jerry Cantrell, bassist Mike Starr,
          and drummer Sean Kinney. The band rose to fame in the early 1990s with
          the release of their second album, "Dirt," which featured hit songs
          such as "Rooster" and "Would?". Their unique blend of heavy metal,
          grunge, and acoustic elements helped to establish them as one of the
          most influential bands of the Seattle grunge scene. Despite their
          success, Alice in Chains struggled with drug addiction and personal
          issues, particularly Staley, who tragically passed away in 2002 from a
          drug overdose. The band went on hiatus for several years, but
          eventually reunited in 2005 with new vocalist William DuVall. Since
          then, Alice in Chains has released three more albums, "Black Gives Way
          to Blue," "The Devil Put Dinosaurs Here," and "Rainier Fog," all of
          which have received critical acclaim. Their music continues to
          resonate with fans of rock and metal, with their legacy firmly
          cemented in the annals of music history.
